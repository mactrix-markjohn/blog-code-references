As someone who is getting into Extended Reality, you will mostly work remotely. The primary reason is that most work you will find will be abroad and not really at home. XR is growing in Africa and Nigeria, but the reality is that it is not yet there, and also, it is not yet there around the world, too. So it is not a peculiar problem only for Africa. 

One of the major problems you will quickly find out, especially if it is your first time working for a foreign company, is that there are no straightforward ways to receive salaries or fees from abroad to your local bank accounts. This is a serious issue because what is the point of working really hard and not being able to gain from it?  
  
You should not really worry too much because there are many platforms that offer these services, especially for Nigerians or Africans. Some of them are GeegPay, Payoneer, Gray, Cleva, WorldRemit, Western Union, and more. 

As someone who has worked with foreign companies since 2021 and has tried multiple platforms out there like WorldRemit, Payoneer, GeegPay, and others, I would talk about each and recommend one that I personally think is really good and the one I use the most. Trust me, getting past this hurdle will save you a lot of stress and headaches. 

#   
WorldRemit

  
WorldRemit is nice, but it does not let Nigerians (I am not sure of other countries) create an account on the platform. What happens is that when your client or employee wants to send money to you, you simply have to provide your client with details of your local bank account. Things like your Government name and local bank account number, and bank name. With this information, your client fills out the WorldRemit payment form and your client sends the money. WorldRemit receives this money and converts it for you to your local bank account.

  
  

# Payoneer

Payoneer has been around for a while now. You simply share your email address with the client, and through Payoneer, they can send you the funds. But that requires that the client is also on Payoneer, which most time, they are not. Personally, my biggest issues with Payoneer are their hidden fees. Payoneer will charge you to receive money, charge you to send money, charge you for using their platform (once a year), and limit the amount of money you must have before you can withdraw your money (currently, it is $25). So, it just makes the experience a bit unpleasant.

# GeegPay  

This is currently my best and recommended option. What GeegPay does for you is to create a Virtual USA bank account and a UK bank account. For USA virtual bank accounts, they do so by partnering with Wells Fargo. So a client abroad will simply send money to the USA account as if they are paying someone else in the US. GeegPay will receive this money and update your account with it. The nice thing about this is that it takes just less than 6 minutes for that money to be processed and sent to your local bank account. The service is so small that it is negligible. They also offer virtual wallets for you to keep your money and spend it too. There are a lot of options there. What I have seen is that it is best for both I and my employer to use.

There are other options out there; you just have to find the one that best fits you and works for you.

If you want to give GeegPay a try, which I recommend, you can do so by registering an account on their platform by following this URL - [https://referral.geegpay.africa/eHxD/i?referral\_code=chukao1498](https://referral.geegpay.africa/eHxD/i?referral_code=chukao1498)
