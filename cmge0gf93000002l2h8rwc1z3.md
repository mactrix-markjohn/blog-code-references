Close your eyes and imagine what 15 years from now might look like. Imagine all these big companies succeeded in creating glasses that replaced our phones. What that means is that we will all be wearing glasses to carry out any digital activities like making calls, texting, watching YouTube, and the rest.

Thinking about this gives me chills. Everyone on earth will all have glasses on their face, the same way we all have mobile phones. I personally donâ€™t think it might happen this way, but there is a high chance that this will be our future.

META, in particular, has made it its ultimate goal to actually replace the phone with glasses. With the release of the Meta RayBan Display and the Orion Glasses, you can see the progression they are making. Apart from Meta, we have other companies from China, like RayNeo, XREAL, Xingyi, INAIR, and others, creating these glasses in mass to also capture the market. We also can not forget about Google, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Apple, working in the background on their own glasses. It is no longer speculation or fiction; these things are becoming reality.

For me personally, what I really hope to see is how glasses like this will transform communication. At the moment, the best way we communicate and still feel highly connected to one another is through Video conferencing like Zoom and Google Meet. We can see ourselves and hear our voices, but imagine for a second that you can communicate with someone, and you will be able to see the person physically, as if the person is right there with you. If we can get to that point in our communication, that will be mind-blowing. At the moment, META Codec Avatar is the most convincing I have seen. Apple Vision Pro also has theirs.

To speak honestly, I have a strong feeling that META might become the go-to company for any XR, and they might win this race because of their strategic positioning in everything related to XR, but we have to see as time goes by.

# **What should you do to prepare for this future?**

This is the question you should ask yourself constantly: how do I prepare, how do I take advantage of the opportunities that this future is to bring? One way is to inform yourself about what augmented reality and XR are all about, read books, watch videos, and the rest. The more you know, the more you are exposed, and the more you will come up with ideas on what to do to take advantage of the potential of this field of technology. By the end of this article, I will provide you with books you can start reading and possibly courses you can take too.

You can also buy these devices like Meta Quest, or Meta RayBan, or Apple Vision Pr,o and the rest. Having these devices gives you firsthand experience with the capabilities of XR and what it entails.

You can subscribe to this newsletter if you have not yet done that.

**PS.**

One of my major purposes or drives to run this Newsletter and my other social media channels is to bridge the gap of unawareness of this tech field by the general public. This is a major issue facing the XR community. Most people in the world are not aware of what we are building in the XR tech space, so I am using these platforms to bring this awareness to people who are not aware. The more people know about the XR tech space, the more solutions we build get attention, and the more interested engineers and developers who have innovative ideas can come into the field.

Another way I try to bridge this gap is by creating learning resources that are very, very inexpensive, so that anyone interested in learning can easily get them and get started with their journey in XR.

To get started with Augmented Reality, you can get this book called **30 Days Guide to Augmented Reality Mastery**. Here is the URL to get it - [https://selfany.com/I3TFUL4T0B](https://selfany.com/I3TFUL4T0B). If you are the kind that loves printed copy, you can get it through Amazon - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2ST1DNM](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2ST1DNM)

There are other books like **C# for Augmented Reality: Using Unity AR Foundation and Niantic Lightship ARDK,** Amazon Link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C52BTHJX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C52BTHJX). If you just want a PDF copy, you can get it here - [https://selfany.com/R2TUEI3HTF](https://selfany.com/R2TUEI3HTF)

You can check these resources out and see if it has what you are looking for. Now is the time to learn and expose yourself to this technology that the whole world is driving towards.

Thank you very much for reading my article. I truly appreciate it. See you in the next newsletter.
